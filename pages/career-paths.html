  ◄──► = Common lateral moves between paths
  </code></pre>

  <p>The arrows between Product, Digital Design, and Data are real -- people hop between these constantly. The ML/AI path is more specialized and harder to enter laterally, but Data &amp; Analytics is the most common on-ramp to it. Sustainability people often come from Product or Analytics backgrounds.</p>

  <!-- ============ PATH 1: ML/AI ============ -->

  <!-- ============ HONEST TRUTH ============ -->

  <h2>The Honest Truth About Getting Started</h2>

  <p>No matter which path you pick, here's what actually matters in the first two years:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Pick a lane, but stay curious.</strong> You need depth to get hired, but breadth to get promoted.</li>
    <li><strong>Build things.</strong> A portfolio project beats a certification every time. Build a fashion recommendation engine, design a digital collection, create a sustainability dashboard -- whatever matches your path.</li>
    <li><strong>Learn the fashion business.</strong> Tech people who don't understand fashion make bad products. Read <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Business of Fashion</a>. Follow fashion weeks. Understand why a $50 t-shirt and a $500 t-shirt exist in the same market.</li>
    <li><strong>Network in both worlds.</strong> Go to fashion events AND tech meetups. The people who bridge both communities are rare and valuable.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't wait for the perfect role.</strong> The first fashion tech job is the hardest to get. Take adjacent roles and move laterally. A data analyst at <a href="https://www.nordstrom.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nordstrom</a> can become an ML engineer at a fashion startup within two years.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The industry is growing fast enough that there's room for everyone. The question isn't whether fashion tech will be big -- it already is. The question is where you want to be when it gets bigger.</p>
